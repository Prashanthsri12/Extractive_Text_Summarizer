# Extractive_Text_Summarizer

Text summarization refers to the technique of shortening long pieces of text. 
The intention is to create a coherent and fluent summary having only the main points outlined in the document.

With such a big amount of data circulating in the digital space, there is need to develop machine learning algorithms 
that can automatically shorten longer texts and deliver accurate summaries that can fluently pass the intended messages.
Furthermore, applying text summarization reduces reading time, accelerates the process of researching for information,
and increases the amount of information that can fit in an area.

The extractive text summarization technique involves pulling keyphrases from the source document and combining them to make a summary. 
The extraction is made according to the defined metric without making any changes to the texts.
